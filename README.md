# PhysicsEngine-alpha-v1.2.0-official

This is the newest stable version of my game/physics engine that I have been working 
on since 2019. The name was meant to be temporary so it may change in the future.

It will be ready for download here no later than 7/10/24. The folder 
will also contain a few demo projects and some basic documentation.
