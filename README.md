# PhysicsEngine-alpha-v1.2.0-official

This is the newest stable version of my game/physics engine that I have been working 
on since 2019. The name was meant to be temporary so it may change in the future.

It will be ready for download here no later than 7/10/24. The folder 
will also contain a few demo projects and some basic documentation.

|| Description: ||
PE.js is an extensive and complex JavaScript game/physics engine for 2d and 3d 
games, animations or simulations. 3d support is still a WIP 
but I plan to focus on it after I release this alpha.
